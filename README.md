## TODO
- [ ] Add the average for the heart rate data (user_tools.py)
- [ ] Add the provisions for other devices (user_tools.py) 
- [ ] Narrow the scope only to the previous day (user_tools.py)
- [ ] Come up with DB to retrieve relevant API Keys - current implementation uses file, long term should store in web service (rag_chain.py)
