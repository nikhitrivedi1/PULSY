And those provide the breaks in the action. Not just the breaks in the action, but the fun stuff. Because, by the way, guys, I thought for a long time, like, yeah, you take care of A, B and C, and the good stuff just takes care of itself. I do not any longer believe that to be true. Unless you schedule these things that you claim are important, they're going to get crowded out by bullshit. And maybe not bullshit, but just less important things. The urgent will crush the important. So I get these things on the calendar, and then I back up and I look at optimal weekly mind allocation, right? Attentional allocation. And there's an incredible cost to cognitive switching if you're just task-switching all day. So I will try my best to format a weekly rhythm, a weekly sequence that allows me to focus on certain types of tasks., Similarity: 0.398997217\nSource: Huberman/Transcripts/html/Dr. Susanna S\u00f8berg- How to Use Cold & Heat Exposure to Improve Your Health.html, Text: ANDREW HUBERMAN: Incredible. I just get a clarification around this 19 degrees Celsius room that they're sleeping in. So, they're under a comforter, a duvet. And you mentioned they have clothes on. The room is 19 degrees Celsius, but the temperature underneath their blanket might not be 19 degrees Celsius. So presumably, it's the cold on their face that's activating the increase in brown fat that was observed. Is that a reasonable expectation?SUSANNA S\u00d8BERG: I think so, yeah, because you have so many receptors in your face. Actually, it's enough. And I think it corresponds very well with the studies showing that you can activate the brown fat just by putting a hand into a bucket of cold water. And I did this experiment myself in my studies just to see how well did they respond to cold water. So, it was 4 degrees Celsius cold water for 4 minutes. And then I just measured blood pressure and heart rate to see, do they have an activation of this?, Similarity: 0.377249151\nSource: Huberman/Transcripts/html/Guest Series | Dr. Andy Galpin- Optimize Your Training Program for Fitness & Longevity.html, Text: Now, all we have to do is fill in the rest intervals, which reflect back, again, the goal. So generally higher rest intervals, which means time that you rest between your sets. Higher somewhere between two to five minutes for things like speed, power, and strength.Perhaps a little bit lower, although as you mentioned, it could also stay high for hypertrophy. And then for endurance, you follow the rest interval that reflects the type of endurance training that you'd like to get.That's walked us through one through nine. We're almost done. We've put together a pretty nice little protocol. It should be well rounded. It should be effective. We've also talked about how to progress it from week to week, keeping it within, again, four to six weeks, maybe up to eight before we then take a back-off., Similarity: 0.366522074"

HUBERMAN: Yeah, I feel like in the, in the last 5, 10 years. Thanks largely in part to Matt Walker's book, Why We Sleep and the Advocacy around Sleep from others.ANDREW D. HUBERMAN: We've come to understand that sleep is essential for mental health, physical health and learning, cognitive performance, physical performance so much so that now people devote immense amounts of attention and, and resources to trying to get the best possible night's sleep. Whereas it was the I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality prior to that.ANDREW D. HUBERMAN: And I, I would love to see a world where people embrace, not the notion of boredom per se, but the notion of gaps, lack of external stimuli coming into our, our eyes and our cognitive system as a means to get smarter, to get more creative, to get better. We just need a language for this., Similarity: 0.531618118\nSource: Huberman/Transcripts/html/Sleep, Vertigo, TBI, OCD, Tips for Travelers, Gut-Brain Axis & More.html, Text: I found that to be a tremendously beneficial practice. Waking up, if I don't feel thoroughly rested, doing a 10 to 30-minute NSDR. Then getting out of bed and continuing the day. And if you don't have time to do that, do that 10-minute, maybe 20-minute later in the day at any point. And I think you'll see terrific results not just because you're recovering some sleep that you lost perhaps during the night or maybe you just need five to six hours, but also because you'll get better at falling and staying deeply asleep through the practice of NSDR in the morning or at some point throughout the day. I wouldn't recommend anything else elaborate unless you're feeling really exhausted during the day. In which case, then I would move to some of the more advanced sleep tools., Similarity: 0.526183069\nSource: Huberman/Transcripts/html/Dr. Cal Newport- How to Enhance Focus and Improve Productivity.html, Text: ANDREW D. HUBERMAN: Perhaps you don't know the answers to those questions. That's ok. You answer the questions in that brief two minute quiz and they match you to the specific mattress ideal for your sleep needs. In my, that was the dusk D US K mattress. I started sleeping on a dusk mattress well, over three years ago and it has significantly improved my sleep.ANDREW D. HUBERMAN: And as a consequence, I feel more focused and alert, I'm better able to do all the things that I need to cognitively physically throughout the day. So, if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, simply go to Helix Sleep. Com/Huberman, take that brief two minute quiz and they'll match you to a customized mattress ideal for you. You'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows., Similarity: 0.511666417"

This practice, NSDR, doesn't involve any mantras, any intention. So there's nothing mystical about it. It's really a self-directed deep relaxation protocol that brings your mind and body into a state that is quite similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And the reason I say that is that your body is very still, but your mind remains active. Your mind is relaxed, if there is such a thing. So this is so to speak, right?
