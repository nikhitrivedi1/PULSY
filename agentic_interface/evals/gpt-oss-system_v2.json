We've figured out how many days per week and how long we're going to work out in those sessions. We then went and selected our exercises.We balance them across the movement patterns and the muscle groups that we need so we're not causing excessive stress on the same exact joint or muscle group over time. We then ordered our exercises based on priority. Because of that, we've identified our goal.
