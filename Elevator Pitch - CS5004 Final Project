Elevator Pitch - CS5004 Final Project

Project Name: TBD

Team: Nikhil Trivedi

- Problem
    - Many of you are wearing an Apple Watch, an Oura Ring, a Fitbit, etc. - 
    - though these devices provide wonderful analytics about the users health, I find that users aren’t able to extract much value out of the interface (charts, plots) because they either 
        a) find the information too overwhleming 
        b) aren’t understanding what the metrics mean
- Solution
    - Develop a chat interface for users to get a summary of their sleep in the context of health expert’s opinion on how to improve or optimize said metric 
    - this way users can also try to understand trends without trying to interpret plots on different windows without fully understanding
- Implementation
    - (Python) RAG Model - referring specifically to information in documents to provide a response
        - this will contain data from the wearables (via API)
        - as well as podcast transcripts (from Andrew Huberman for PoC)
    - (Java)
        - GUI - render chat interface with conversation memory provided
        - User Input → age, gender, etc.
        - Wearables.Wearables Input → Oura Ring, Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.
            - create Wearables.Wearables Interface - with abstract class for shared methods
        - RAG Input
            - send chat text input over to the RAG Model + wearables data + individuals data

- Class List (Estimated)
    - Java
        - UserProfile
        - Wearable (Interface)
            - AppleWatch
            - Wearables.OuraRing
        - GUI
        - QueryResponse (HTTP)
        - ChatHistory

- Challenges
    - getting java GUI to send information to Python application 
    - fine tuning the RAG model to the point where insights are valuable
